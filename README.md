# ABAP Highlighter
A lightweight plug-in for [Eclipse](eclipse) that works with and modifies the [ADT Plugin](ADT) to provide better syntax highlighting for the [ABAP](ABAP) programming language.
It aims to address the highly dissatisfactory ADT syntax highlighting, which groups together tokens with vastly different meanings, to make looking at ABAP code slightly
more bearable.

The highlighter is intended to work for any ABAP version - though very deprecated or recent syntax may not be fully supported. If you encouter issues using the highlighter, please
open an issue with a clear reproducible example :)

# Supported Token Types
- ✔️ Functions / Methods
- ✔️ Identifiers
- ✔️ Keywords
- ✔️ Fields
- ✔️ Comments
- ✔️ Delimiters
- ✔️ Operators
- ✔️ Literals
- ✔️ Table Keys
- ❌ Tables *

\* Currently treated as type or identifier, depending on the context. Impossible to derive outside selection without DDIC lookup.

# How does it work?
The plugin checks for active ADT Editors and modifies their `PresentationReconciler`, the component that is responsible
for repairing text changes and (re-)creating color tokens based on the contents.

This way, the plug-in can rely on SAP's ABAP Development Tools for the heavy lifting, focusing only on improving the visual aspect.

As of now, the Syntax Highlighter is entirely text-context-based. It can only derive the meaning of words based on what tokens it has already found
and, occassionally, by checking the next few tokens. If the context required to derive the meaning of an identifier is not located in the statement
scope itself, much less in the active module, the scanner is unable to look up information about it.
